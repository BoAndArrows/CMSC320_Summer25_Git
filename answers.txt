Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git as a program has many uses that would make us consider using it. We might want to maintain a history of our code and development, create new features on a branch of the main code that prevents a live service application from being taken down while tinkering, being able to collaborate with other developers, and in addition have spotters and peer review from other developers.
